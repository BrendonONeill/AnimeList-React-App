# Anime Tracking App
This is an app to look up anime that has or is airing, this uses the janki api that get information from the My Anime List website. It allows you to see what is the most rated or most loved anime, as well as sort out anime by their genres or search up a word to find a certain anime.  

## Lessons learned
This was my first big project using react so I learnt a lot about how react renders pages and that using components to reuse for the project. 

I got a better understanding of hooks and how to use them within my app from useState to update Infomation on the page to useContext so don't need to prop drill around the whole project. 

I also learned that not using a framework and creating my own css took a long time as I changed a lot of the design as I developed the app. But by creating this app with my own css I have improved my css skills and have a better understanding of how sections of css works. 

## Potential future features
If I continue to improve this application I would like to add a feature to creat accounts to track different animes and rank your top animes. I would use firebase as the backend or if I feel up to the task I could use mongodb to store the information.

## Deployment
