### Updates being developed
Working on adding in useContext to the project as with prop drill it is starting to get really messy with all the prop and more to add. this will help with cleaning up some of the code and making it easier to get information anywhere within the app.

Error handling/loading messages will be added to notify the user what is going on when the information isnt displayed on the app.

Custom hooks will be added for fetch and some fuction to clean up the code to make it more easier to understand
